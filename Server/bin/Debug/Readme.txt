I have created "CompositeTextAnalyzer" project and also included project "Metadatatool". 
But a separate folder has been created for it, so run it as a separate project and I 
have provided separate run.bat file for Metadatatool.

The solution file for metadatatool is not being created separately beacause it's part of
"CompositeTextAnalyzer" and so compile.bat for "CompositeTextAnalyzer" will compile the
Metadatatool also. But use separate run.bat files as provided.
